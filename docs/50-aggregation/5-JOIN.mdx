# 👐 $lookup (JOINs in MongoDB)

`$lookup` in MongoDB serves a similar purpose to **JOINs** in SQL. It enables combining data from multiple collections by performing an equality match between fields.

## **🔹 Understanding $lookup**

The `$lookup` stage is used to fetch related documents from another collection, similar to `INNER JOIN` or `LEFT JOIN` in SQL.

### **Syntax**

```js
{
  $lookup: {
    from: "<foreign_collection>",  // Collection to join
    localField: "<local_field>",   // Field in current collection
    foreignField: "<foreign_field>", // Field in foreign collection
    as: "<output_array>"             // Output field
  }
}
```

- `from`: The target collection for joining.
- `localField`: The field in the current collection.
- `foreignField`: The field in the target collection.
- `as`: The output field containing the joined data as an array.

## 🔹 Joining 2 collections

### 👐 Example 1: Joining Authors collection with Books\*\*

🔍 **Get book details along with their authors**

```js
db.authors.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "books",
      localField: "books",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "booksWritten",
    },
  },
]);
```

### **Equivalent SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT books.*, authors.*
FROM authors
LEFT JOIN books ON authors._id = books.author_id;
```

:::info
The result in MongoDB will have an array (`authorDetails`) instead of flat columns.

## 🔹 Handling Unwinding ($unwind)

Since `$lookup` produces an **array**, we can flatten it using `$unwind`.

### Example 2: Get Book Titles and Single Author Name

```js
db.authors.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "books",
      localField: "books",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "booksWritten",
    },
  },
  { $unwind: "$booksWritten" },
  { $project: { name: 1, "booksWritten.title": 1, _id: 0 } },
]);
```

:::info
The $lookup operation creates an array within each book document. Using $unwind then flattens this array, resulting in a separate document for every book and each author.

## **🚀 Exercise**

👐 Fetch books with their associated reviews.
👐 Get authors and the books they have written.
👐 Use `$unwind` to show each book-author pair separately.
