# 👐 ORDER BY → .sort() & LIMIT → .limit()

In SQL, we use `ORDER BY` to sort query results and `LIMIT` to restrict the number of returned rows. MongoDB provides the `.sort()` and `.limit()` methods to achieve the same.

---

## **Sorting in MongoDB**

- `{ field: 1 }` → **Ascending order** (A → Z, smallest to largest)
- `{ field: -1 }` → **Descending order** (Z → A, largest to smallest)
- You can sort by multiple fields, just like SQL.

## **Limiting Results**

- `.limit(n)` restricts the number of documents returned.
- Used together with `.sort()`, it helps fetch the **top N** results.

### 1: Top 5 Books with the Highest Inventory

```js
db.books.find().sort({ totalInventory: -1 }).limit(5);
```

**Equivalent SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY totalInventory DESC LIMIT 5;
```

This fetches the **5 books with the highest stock**.

### 2: Get the title of top 10 Fiction Books by highest page count

```js
db.books
  .find({ genres: "Fiction" }, { title: 1, pages: 1 })
  .sort({ pages: -1 })
  .limit(10);
```

:::info

Along with the title, we fetched pages as well to ensure that we are getting the right results.

:::

**Equivalent SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT title, pages FROM books WHERE genres='Fiction' ORDER BY pages DESC LIMIT 10;
```

This returns the **top 10 available books** in the "Science Fiction" genre.

## **Exercises**

👐 Retrieve the top 3 books with the most reviews.  
👐 Find the **first 10 books** alphabetically by `title`.  
👐 Get the **latest 5 books** added to the database (assume a `createdAt` field).  
👐 Find **the 2 oldest authors** (assume a `birthYear` field).  
👐 Retrieve **the top 7 books** with the highest `rating`.
