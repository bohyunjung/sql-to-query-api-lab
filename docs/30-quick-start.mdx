# üëê Quick Start

For the impatient, AKA all of us:

## Install Compass

## Connect Compass to your Atlas cluster

### 1. Click on the "Add connection" button on the home page

### 5. Switch to the library database in the shell

Once the shell is loaded, execute: `use library` to ensure you are in the correct database.
